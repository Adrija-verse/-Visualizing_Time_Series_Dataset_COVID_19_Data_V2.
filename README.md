# 📊 Visualizing Time Series Dataset: COVID-19 Data V2

## 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 and Ebola time series data to uncover trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities. Using Python-based data visualization techniques, it transforms raw datasets into intuitive visual narratives that support public understanding and data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize temporal progression of COVID-19 and Ebola across countries
- Compare regional impacts and healthcare responses
- Enable exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visual tools
- Extract actionable insights from pandemic data
- Lay groundwork for future forecasting and modeling

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- *Python*  
- *Pandas* – Data manipulation  
- *NumPy* – Numerical operations
- *Plotly* – interactive operations 
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – Static visualizations  
- *Colab Notebook* – Development environment  

## 📂 Dataset 
- *Format*: CSV files with daily records of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- *Scope*: Global data from Jan 2020 to mid-2021  

## 🔄 Workflow Summary
1. *Data Collection* – Importing global COVID-19 and Ebola datasets  
2. *Data Cleaning* – Handling missing values, formatting dates  
3. *Preprocessing* – Aggregating by country/date, feature engineering  
4. *Visualization* – Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps  
5. *Insight Extraction* – Annotating trends, comparing regions  
6. (Optional) *Modeling* – ARIMA-based forecasting with train/test split  

## 📈 Sample Visuals
- Daily confirmed cases by country  
- Rolling averages of deaths and recoveries  
- Heatmaps showing outbreak intensity over time  

## 📌 Notes
- No primary survey was conducted; analysis is based on secondary data  
- No formal hypothesis testing was performed, but visual trends support exploratory insights  
- The project can be extended with interactive dashboards or predictive models
